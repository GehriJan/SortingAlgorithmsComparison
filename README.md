# SortingAlgorithmsComparison
Different Sorting Algorithms compared via Python.

The implemented Algorithms can be added to the List "`sortingAlgos`".

Lists of different sizes are being created, sorted with each Algorithm out of place and the time it took is being stored in "`times`".

## Parameters
The creation of lists can be edited with the following parameters:
| Parametername | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `anzPoints` | Number of used list + 1 (for the point in the origin) |
| `stepSize` | stepsize of length of list |
| `maxRand` | maximum of random number generation, determines intervall |

## Examples

Parameters: anzPoints/stepSize/maxRand
Algorithms: selectionSort, quickSort, mergeSort
Parameters:
